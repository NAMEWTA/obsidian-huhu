/**
 * In one observed environment (Obsidian on Electron 43.3, a synthetic Escape followed by a window focus) the host's
 * asynchronous filesystem completion never arrived for requests issued right then: the promise stayed pending forever
 * while new requests succeeded. The native cause is not located. A serial queue holder awaiting such a request would
 * block every later operation, so read-only requests are issued again once they stall, as a compatibility guard.
 * The first attempt to settle wins; a stall on every attempt is reported as an error instead of an endless wait.
 * Never use this for writes. Attempts cannot be cancelled, and nested guards keep their own timers: when an outer
 * attempt wins, an inner guard may still issue a bounded number of late re-issues before it gives up.
